## Configuration

### YAML Configuration File

The extension stores its shortcuts configuration in a YAML file (`.vscode/shortcuts.yaml` for workspace or `~/.vscode-shortcuts/.vscode/shortcuts.yaml` for global). You can access the configuration file through the gear icon in the Shortcuts panel.

### VS Code Settings

The extension provides the following VS Code settings (accessible via Settings UI or `settings.json`):

- **`workspaceShortcuts.openMarkdownInPreview`** (default: `false`): When enabled, Markdown (.md) files will automatically open in preview mode instead of edit mode when created or opened from shortcuts.

#### Cloud Sync Settings

- **`workspaceShortcuts.sync.enabled`** (default: `false`): Enable cloud synchronization of shortcuts configuration
- **`workspaceShortcuts.sync.autoSync`** (default: `true`): Automatically sync configuration changes to cloud
- **`workspaceShortcuts.sync.providers`** (default: `["vscode"]`): Enabled sync providers (options: "vscode", "azure")
- **`workspaceShortcuts.sync.syncInterval`** (default: `300`): Periodic sync interval in seconds (0 to disable)

## Requirements

- VSCode version 1.74.0 or higher
- Node.js (for development)

## Platform Notes

- Windows: Due to OS limitations in native file dialogs, selecting both files and folders simultaneously in a single dialog is not supported. On Windows, right‚Äëclick a group and use "Add Files to Group" or "Add Folders to Group". On macOS/Linux, the single "Add to Group" entry allows selecting both in one dialog.

If you encounter any issues, please file them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/plusplusoneplusplus/shortcuts/issues).
