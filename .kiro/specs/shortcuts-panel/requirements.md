# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a custom left panel to the VS Code extension that provides quick access to frequently used folders and files. Similar to the built-in file explorer, this shortcuts panel allows users to configure specific folders as shortcuts, making it easier to navigate large projects without browsing through the entire directory structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on a large project, I want to configure specific folders as shortcuts in a dedicated panel, so that I can quickly access important directories without navigating through the entire project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL display a new panel in the left sidebar
2. WHEN a user opens the shortcuts panel THEN the system SHALL show a tree view similar to the file explorer
3. WHEN a user has no configured shortcuts THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with instructions to add shortcuts
4. WHEN a user adds a folder shortcut THEN the system SHALL save the configuration to a YAML file in the .vscode folder and persist across VS Code sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add and remove folder shortcuts through the panel interface, so that I can customize my workspace navigation without editing configuration files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks in the shortcuts panel THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with "Add Folder" option
2. WHEN a user selects "Add Folder" THEN the system SHALL open a folder picker dialog
3. WHEN a user selects a folder THEN the system SHALL add it to the shortcuts panel and save the configuration
4. WHEN a user right-clicks on a shortcut item THEN the system SHALL show options to "Remove" or "Rename" the shortcut
5. WHEN a user removes a shortcut THEN the system SHALL update the panel and update the YAML configuration file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate through shortcut folders and open files directly from the panel, so that I can access my files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a folder shortcut THEN the system SHALL expand/collapse the folder to show its contents
2. WHEN a user clicks on a file in the shortcuts panel THEN the system SHALL open the file in the editor
3. WHEN a user double-clicks on a folder THEN the system SHALL expand the folder if collapsed or collapse if expanded
4. WHEN a folder contains subfolders THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate tree indentation and expand/collapse icons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shortcuts panel to show file and folder icons, so that I can quickly identify different file types and navigate more intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying folders in the shortcuts panel THEN the system SHALL use appropriate folder icons (open/closed states)
2. WHEN displaying files in the shortcuts panel THEN the system SHALL use file type-specific icons based on file extensions
3. WHEN a folder is expanded THEN the system SHALL show an open folder icon
4. WHEN a folder is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show a closed folder icon

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shortcuts configuration to be stored in a YAML file within my project, so that I can version control my shortcuts and share them with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension initializes THEN the system SHALL look for a shortcuts configuration file at `.vscode/shortcuts.yaml`
2. WHEN no configuration file exists THEN the system SHALL create an empty configuration file with default structure
3. WHEN a user adds or removes shortcuts THEN the system SHALL update the YAML file immediately
4. WHEN the YAML file is modified externally THEN the system SHALL reload the shortcuts panel to reflect changes
5. WHEN the YAML file contains invalid syntax THEN the system SHALL show an error message and use default empty configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shortcuts panel to integrate seamlessly with VS Code's theming and UI patterns, so that it feels like a native part of the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shortcuts panel is displayed THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's current theme colors and styling
2. WHEN the user changes VS Code themes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the panel appearance
3. WHEN displaying the panel THEN the system SHALL follow VS Code's standard tree view interaction patterns
4. WHEN the panel is focused THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, etc.)
