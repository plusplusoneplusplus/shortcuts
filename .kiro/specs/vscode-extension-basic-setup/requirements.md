# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a basic VSCode extension setup with the fundamental structure, configuration files, and boilerplate code needed to develop a functional extension. The setup should include proper TypeScript configuration, package.json with extension metadata, activation events, and a simple command implementation to demonstrate the extension works.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a basic VSCode extension project structure, so that I can start developing extension functionality with proper tooling and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a package.json file with proper VSCode extension metadata
2. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include extension manifest fields (name, displayName, description, version, engines, categories, activationEvents, main, contributes)
3. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL configure TypeScript with appropriate compiler options for VSCode extensions
4. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include VSCode extension API type definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper build and development tooling configured, so that I can compile, test, and debug my extension efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build system is configured THEN the system SHALL include webpack or esbuild configuration for bundling
2. WHEN the build system is configured THEN the system SHALL provide npm scripts for compilation, watching, and packaging
3. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN the system SHALL include launch.json configuration for debugging
4. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN the system SHALL include tasks.json for build automation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic command implementation, so that I can verify the extension loads and executes properly in VSCode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL register at least one command in the command palette
2. WHEN the registered command is executed THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL activate based on defined activation events
4. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN the system SHALL include all necessary files and exclude development dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project documentation and configuration, so that I can understand how to develop, build, and distribute the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a README.md with setup and development instructions
2. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a .vscodeignore file to exclude unnecessary files from packaging
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include appropriate .gitignore entries for Node.js and VSCode extension development
4. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a CHANGELOG.md template for tracking version changes
