/**
 * Shared types for the canvas → self-contained HTML export pipeline.

 *   Layer A  buildCanvasHtmlDocument  — pure serializer (this dir)
 *   Layer B  asset extraction + inline (jsdom)
 *   Layer C  mermaid pre-render        (jsdom)
 *   Layer D  excalidraw rasterization  (jsdom)
 *   Layer E  exportCanvasAsHtml        — orchestrator
 *   Layer F  CanvasPanel "Export as HTML" menu item
 *
 * These types are shared across the layers so the pure core and the I/O-bound
 * adapters agree on a single contract.
