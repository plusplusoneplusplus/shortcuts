# Processes Tab — UI/UX Specification

**Document type:** Formal UX Specification  
**Scope:** CoC Dashboard → Processes (Top-Level Tab)  
**Purpose:** Authoritative reference for validating any future UI/UX changes to the Processes tab.  
**Version:** 1.1.0

---

## 1. Overview

The **Processes Tab** is a top-level dashboard tab providing a global view of all AI task queue activity across all repositories. It reuses the same `ChatListPane` + `ChatDetailPane` pattern as the per-repo Activity/Chats tab (formerly named `ActivityListPane` / `ActivityDetailPane`) but operates at the global scope. It shows running, queued, and historical tasks with full conversation detail, SSE streaming, follow-up messaging, queue management (pause/resume/reorder/freeze/cancel), and process detail with workflow DAG visualization. While the initial fetch is in flight, a `ProcessesViewSkeleton` placeholder is rendered (with a 300 ms minimum display time so the skeleton is always perceptible).

### 1.1 Tab Identity

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Tab label | `Processes` (icon in top bar) |
| Tab position | Top-level tab |
| Default tab | No |
| URL fragment | `#processes` |
| Deep-link URL | `#process/queue_<taskId>` or `#processes/<taskId>` |

---

## 2. User Personas

| Persona | Description | Primary Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Operator** | Engineers monitoring global AI task execution | View all running/queued tasks across repos, manage queue |
| **Developer** | Engineers interacting with AI tasks | Send follow-ups, review conversations, cancel tasks |
| **Power user** | Advanced users managing task execution | Pause/resume queue, reorder tasks, freeze items |

---

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Global Queue View

**US-01 — View all running tasks**
> As an operator, I want to see all currently executing AI tasks across all repositories.

- **Given** the Processes tab is open
- **When** tasks are running
- **Then** a "Running" section lists all running tasks globally with type icon, display name, and live elapsed-time counter

---

**US-02 — View all queued tasks**
> As an operator, I want to see all tasks waiting to execute.

- **Given** the Processes tab is open
- **When** tasks are queued
- **Then** a "Queued" section lists all queued tasks in execution priority order

---

**US-03 — View task history**
> As an operator, I want to browse completed tasks across all repositories.

- **Given** the Processes tab is open
- **When** completed tasks exist
- **Then** a "History" section lists completed tasks in reverse-chronological order

---

**US-04 — Pause and resume the global queue**
> As a power user, I want to pause the entire queue so no new tasks start.

- **Given** the queue is running
- **When** the user triggers Pause (`POST /api/queue/pause`)
- **Then** all queued tasks remain queued but do not start; a "Paused" indicator is shown
- **When** the user triggers Resume (`POST /api/queue/resume`)
- **Then** the queue resumes normal execution

---

### 3.2 Task Interaction

**US-05 — View task conversation**
> As a developer, I want to read the full AI conversation for any task.

- **Given** a task is selected
- **When** the detail pane loads
- **Then** `GET /api/queue/:taskId` and `GET /api/processes/:processId` fetch the conversation; all turns are shown (user prompt, AI response, tool calls)

---

**US-06 — Send a follow-up message**
> As a developer, I want to send a follow-up message to continue a conversation.

- **Given** a task is selected in the detail pane
- **When** the user types a message and submits
- **Then** the follow-up is enqueued or delivered immediately based on `deliveryMode`

---

**US-07 — Stream AI output in real time**
> As a developer, I want to see AI response tokens appear incrementally.

- **Given** a running task is selected
- **When** the AI is generating a response
- **Then** tokens appear via SSE streaming (`GET /api/processes/:id/stream`)

---

**US-08 — Navigate to workflow DAG**
> As an operator, I want to view the DAG visualization for workflow tasks.

- **Given** a `run-workflow` task with repo info is selected
- **When** the user clicks the task
- **Then** the view navigates to `#repos/<repoId>/workflow/<processId>` for the full DAG view

---

### 3.3 Queue Management

**US-09 — Reorder queued tasks**
> As a power user, I want to change the order of queued tasks.

- **Given** two or more tasks are queued
- **When** the user drags a task or uses context menu actions (Move to Top, Move Up, Move Down)
- **Then** the queue order updates and the server is notified

---

**US-10 — Cancel a task**
> As a developer, I want to cancel a running or queued task.

- **Given** a task is running or queued
- **When** the user clicks Cancel
- **Then** `DELETE /api/queue/:id` cancels the task; it moves to History

---

**US-11 — Freeze a queued task**
> As a power user, I want to freeze a task so it does not execute until unfrozen.

- **Given** a task is queued
- **When** the user selects Freeze from the context menu
- **Then** the task shows a frozen indicator and is skipped during execution

---

### 3.4 Process Detail

**US-12 — View process detail**
> As an operator, I want to see the full process record for a task.

- **Given** a task is selected
- **When** the detail loads
- **Then** `GET /api/processes/:id` returns the process with conversation turns, metadata, and status

---

**US-13 — Resume a task in terminal**
> As a developer, I want to continue a task in my local terminal.

- **Given** a task has an associated process
- **When** the user clicks "Resume in Terminal"
- **Then** `POST /api/processes/:pid/resume-cli` attaches the task to the terminal

## 4. Feature Inventory & Acceptance Criteria

| Live elapsed timer | Running tasks show timer incrementing every 1s |
| Filter dropdown | Multi-select by task type |
| Search | Real-time filter by displayName / title / prompt |
| Context menu | State-appropriate actions per task |
| Drag-and-drop | Reorder queued tasks only |
| Pause indicator | Shown when queue is paused |

### 4.2 Detail Pane (ChatDetailPane)

| Feature | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| Conversation display | All turns in chronological order |
| SSE streaming | Incremental token display |
| Follow-up input | Text input with mode selector and slash commands |
| Cancel button | Visible for running tasks |
| Resume in Terminal | Available when process exists |
| Workflow DAG navigation | `run-workflow` tasks navigate to DAG view |

### 4.3 Layout

| Feature | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| Desktop | Split pane: ~`w-64` (tablet) / `w-80` (desktop) list + detail |
| Mobile | List or detail with back navigation |
| Loading | `ProcessesViewSkeleton` shimmer placeholder (≥300 ms) until first queue + history fetch resolves |

---

## 5. Behavioral Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| INV-01 | The Processes tab shows tasks from all repositories, not scoped to a single repo |
| INV-02 | Selecting a `run-workflow` task with repo info navigates to the repo's workflow DAG view |
| INV-03 | If the selected task ID vanishes from lists, `GET /api/queue/:id` verifies existence; on failure, selection is cleared |
| INV-04 | Queue pause/resume affects all repositories globally |
| INV-05 | History fetch failure results in empty history, not an error state |
| INV-06 | The `ChatPreferencesProvider` wraps content with `workspaceId` from `selectedRepoId` (may be empty for global) |
