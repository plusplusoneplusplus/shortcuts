# Go Deep

This skill provides structured approaches for thorough investigation and verification tasks.

## Available Methods

### Deep Research
Use [deep-research](references/deep-research.prompt.md) for multi-phase research:
1. **Scout Phase**: Identify 5-8 key subtopics
2. **Parallel Deep-Dive**: Research each subtopic independently
3. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into a cohesive report

### Multi-Model Verification
Use [deep-verify](references/deep-verify.prompt.md) to verify arguments using multiple AI models:
1. **Task Definition**: Prepare unbiased verification brief
2. **Parallel Verification**: Dispatch to independent sub-agents
3. **Consensus Analysis**: Synthesize findings, surface agreements and conflicts
